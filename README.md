# CIS1051FinalProject

Description of Final Project:
For my final project, I created a text-based adventure game called The Eye of Malthor. In this adventure game, you are faced with many choices, like which path do you want to choose or what action do you want to do. In this game, the choices can either lead to you to victory or death. That's why it's important to pay attention to the text and choose your options carefully. The main objective of this game is to defeat Malthor, the boss of the dungeon. If the player doesn't choose to face Malthor, then they'll be faced with disastrous consequences. There are multiple endings in this game, so come try it out and try to find all of them!

Why did I choose to do a text-based adventure game?
I chose to do this project as I wanted to make a game. As I'm not really skilled in python, I decided to make it a text-based game. This allowed me to create an adventure game with my skill level.

What did I learn while making this project?
While making this project, I understood the process it takes to create a game. When creating a game, there are many steps that people don't realize. Although my game looked fairly easy to do, there was many things that I didn't take into account. This project gave me a new appreciation for people who create games.

What are some difficulties I faced when making the project?
While making this project, I had to endure many difficulties. One major problem that I had when making this project was making sure all the coding worked while there was a cohesive story. I had to test my coding every step of the way to make sure that everything worked and made sense. There would be times where I would either forget to include things, or didn't know what to do. However, after many trial and errors, I was able to overcome these challenges and finish my game.
