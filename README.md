# CIS1051FinalProject

Description of Final Project:
For my final project, I created a text-based adventure game called The Eye of Malthor. In this adventure game, you are faced with many choices like which path to take or what action you want to do. In this game, the choices can either lead to your death, some bad endings, or a good ending. That's why it's important to pay attention to the text and choose your options carefully. The main objective of this game is to defeat Malthor, the boss of the dungeon. If the player doesn't choose to face Malthor, then they'll be faced with disastrous consequences. Come try this game out and find out all the endings!

Why did I choose to do a text-based adventure game?
I chose to do this project as I wanted to make a game. As I'm not really skilled in python, I decided to go to make the game a text-based game. In this way, I could create a game with many options to choose from, but it wouldn't very hard to do.

What did I learn while making this project?
While making this project, I learned that I didn't know much of python. Due to my lack of knowledge, there was many things I couldn't include in my game. For instance, making an inventory of the player and creating a save state. However, to get around this, I would find creative ways to make my code work and make sense. I also learned that I really enjoy making projects like this. 

What are some difficulties I faced when making the project?
While making this project, I had to endure many difficulties to finsih my project. One major difficulty I had when making this project was making sure all the coding worked while there was a cohesive story. I had to test my coding every step of the way to make sure that everything worked. There would be times where I would either forget to include things, or didn't know how to do. However, after many trial and errors, I was able to finish my game.
